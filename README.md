My data science and analytics internship tasks

# Task 1: Exploring and visualizing simple dataset

Objective:
Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset.

Dataset used: Iris

Tools: pandas, matplotlib and seaborn

Basic visualizations:
* Scatter plot to analyze relationships between variables.
* Histogram to examine data distributions.
* Box plot to detect outliers and spread of values.

# Task 2: Credit Risk prediction

Objective: 
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan. 

Dataset used: 
Loan Prediction Dataset

Instructions: 
*	Handling missing data appropriately. 
*	Visualizing key features such as loan amount, education, and income. 
*	Training a classification model like Logistic Regression or Decision Tree. 
*	Evaluating the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix. 

# Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: 
 Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. 

Dataset used: 
 Churn Modelling Dataset 

Instructions:

*	Cleaning and prepare the dataset.  
*	Encoding categorical features such as geography and gender. 
*	Training a classification model. 
*	Analyzing feature importance to understand what influences churn. 

# Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

Objective: 
 Estimate the medical insurance claim amount based on personal data.
 
Dataset used: 
 Medical Cost Personal Dataset 
 
Instructions: 
*	Training a Linear Regression model to predict charges. 
*	Visualizing how BMI, age, and smoking status impact insurance charges.  
*	Evaluating model performance using MAE and RMSE. 

# Task 5:

Objective: 
 Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer. 
 
Dataset used: 
 Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
 
Instructions: 
*	Performing basic data exploration on features such as age, job, and marital status. 
*	Training a Logistic Regression or Decision Tree classifier. 
*	Analyzing the results to identify which customer groups are more likely to accept the offer.
